# InjectionTool

IÂ´m new to PS and also to coding. I did this back when i first startet.

This tool let you choose via file-explorer, in which folder to start, and recursivly 
goes through all subfolders and searches for a specific file ending (like in my case .mpf).
It opens the file and puts what ever needed on the top first line oft the file.

I added a progress-bar so the console shows progress. 
I used the .bat file for easy handling - it was a tool for production area and 
i want to keep it simple without using any prompt etc.

You may find it helpful for some usecases, even if just parts of it.
